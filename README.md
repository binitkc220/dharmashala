## Introduction

This project started with the mindset of retyping and compiling the lab sheets, and clearing up the convoluted course structure of Electronics Engineering. Now, we have strong emphasis on adding many important information and resources related to both Electronics and Computer Engineering.

We have adopted the model of iterative refinement by the community to keep the resource materials update, and error free. Every viewers and users of this resources can benefit from the high quality materials that are iteratively refined by the community. You can fork this repo and make a pull request in order to make contribution to this repo.

## Getting Started

In order to view this repository, you can just browse this markdown document, following the hyperlinks that guide you to the resource you want.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from both Electronics and Computer Engineering enthusiasts! Please follow our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to ensure smooth collaboration. If you're new to contributing to open source, check out our [New Contributors Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#new-contributors-guide).

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of this repository looks like this:

    Root
    +
    +-- Subjects    : It contains all the subjects available in both Engineering courses
    +   +-- COA     : The computer organization and architecture resource folder
    +   +-- Communication-System: The resource folder for communication system
    +   +-- ... etc.
    +
    +-- Departments : For now it contains markdown documents for each Dept.
    +   +-- BCT.md  : A markdown document for course structure for BCT
    +   +-- BEI.md  : A markdown document for course structure for BEI
    +
    +-- ... : Till now, there are just two important folders

1. Subject Folder:

Each subject folder will contain a syllabus.md file and other files needed for that subjects.
