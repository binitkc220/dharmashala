# 1st semester, Electronics

Welcome everyone.

This is the first semester of your Engineering.

If you had high hopes, you will see many expectations shattered.

But if you keep your mind open, and hopes low, you will be surprised in unexpected ways.

Important subjects:
1. Digital Logic
    This electronics subject is one of the foundational subject of this Engineering.
    
    This subject starts with simple logic and binary arithmatic that you already know, but don't make a mistake of thinking you don't need any effort.

    Everything here is easy, but you do need to work on them. Some of the things here takes time to grasp, but they lay the foundation in understanding the Electronics from the bits.

    Tips: Do the lab well, try to implement everything in proteus.

2. Computer Programming
    You will be taught mainly the C language, and will also touch the Fortran language. C is pretty important. You will learn basics of input output, calculation, looping, array, structures, pointers and file handling.

    The Fortran is also pretty easy.

    Tips: Do the lab well, and try to implement well. Don't expect good marks in exam. Exams will be tested in tradional ways, and you will be expected in writing code in tradional ways. This subject is for yourself to improve your skill in playing with the code. So, the more you play with C the better.

    Try to use vscode. If you use linux, that's even better.

    Project: You can do any project from simple to complex. Try to learn some library like SDL (they are pretty easy if you have coded before.)

3. Engineering Mathematics:
    Mathematics is one of the most important subject for any field, and very much so for Engineering field, and the Information Techonology field.

    You will expand your knowledge over what you've learned in your +2.
    
    You will learn to use Integrations to solve more difficult problems in easier ways. You will learn to use Beta and Gamma (Factorial's generalization) functions, and more. You will also learn to transform coordinates, and more skills. This is one of the foundations.

4. Basic Electrical Engineering
    This subject will stay relavant for only upto a few semesters, and after that you won't need it much.

    Most things you will have already learnt in the +2. You should practice skills in solving the Star-Delta resistor combinations, and solving circuits in AC using imaginary numbers.

    Later, you will have to deal with AC circuit's properties, use integrations to find values. If you understand concept well, you will have no problem. You will also have to learn about wattmeters.
    
    Learn this subject with reasonable fluency if you want later electrical subjects to go well.

5. Engineering Drawing I
    This incomplete drawing subject is a fun subject to unleash your creativity, divert your mind from the core Engineering for a time, and practice to stay consistent, because you will need to practice a lot of sheets.

    Take this subject as a way to improve your spatial understanding, improve mental ability to visualize and reason, and put it into a paper.

    The things you learn in this subject wouldn't be used much anywhere in this engineering. But your practice in this subject will make you a better and more capable learner.

    Tips: Do at least 1 question of every type. Understand the very basic very clearly. Try to visualize.

6. Engineering Physics
    This subject will expand upon the physics that you learn in the +2. 

    You have to try to understand many concepts yourself, try to visualize and think the concepts through. The more you practice the better you get.
    
    If you are thinking of going into Quantum Mechanics, learn every concepts well. It will help you immensely.
