# Guidelines:

Every resources should try to mention these things:


1. Clearly mention what you should already know and what you will know from these.
3. Mention the learning strategy and what to focus on.
3. Sample questions for testing previous knowledge. and link to cover that knowledge
4. Sample questions that this topic would cover, also used to guide how much focus is needed to understand this topic.
5. These preamble to be fairly short. (However, if needed it can be as long as needed, but for strong reasoning only.)
